## Important Note Regarding google-services.json

If you encounter the :app:processDebugGoogleServices error during the build process, it's likely due to the absence of the google-services.json file, which is essential for the Google Services Plugin to function properly.

To fix this issue:

1. Obtain the google-services.json file:
   - Navigate to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Select your project or create a new one if necessary.
   - Click on 'Add app' and follow the setup instructions.
   - At the end of the setup process, you'll be able to download the google-services.json file.

2. Add the google-services.json file to your project:
   - Place the google-services.json file in the app/ directory of your Android project.

3. Ensure the file is not tracked by Git:
   - Add google-services.json to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your public repository, as it contains sensitive information.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the build error and securely integrate Google Services into your application.
